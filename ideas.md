# Ideas
This is where you can find and store any ideas you'd like to see implemented somewhere. Ideas should have three parts: tags, a title or 
summary, and a detail. <!-- As this list grows we'll need to come up with a more accessible way to store these -->

* Tags: Can include what kind of game where it could be implemented (e.g. RPG, FPS, or RTS) and what kind of idea it is (e.g. mechanic
or aesthetic) or anything else you think might be useful for understanding context
* Title: Should just be a few words that gives a broad idea of what it's about (e.g. Constant Health Drain, Map Building, Assassin Mage Guild)
* Detail: This should be just a short paragraph detailing what your idea is and what constraints an implementer might face. Need more
than just a single paragraph? Maybe try splitting it up into multiple ideas or start a GDD.

<!-- Using the hashes like this allows for each idea to be indexed and deep linked -->
##### Example Idea:
This is what an idea would look like. There would probably be more to the summary, but what else can you really say about an example?
Tags: example

##### Map-Based Conquest
One of the older Command and Conquer games (maybe Red Alert?) showed what area of the map you had conquered to that point. This could be
extended if the player were allowed to actually choose what area they want to attack next. Each area would have some strategic advantage
which would allow their choices to really affect every step of the game.
