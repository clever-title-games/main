# Game Design Docs
This directory is where you'll find GDD's in their varying stages of completeness. Take inspiration, contribute,
whatever you need. Just make it awesome.

Not sure what a Game Design Doc is? No worries. High level is, as you might think, all the design decisions that have been 
made for a particular game. Still unclear? Google is your friend here. Or ask the community!
