# [Clever Title] Games

## Who We Are
This is a community for everyone who wants anything to do with game development. Ever think to yourself, "That would be an awesome idea, but how
do I even get started?" Well, that's what we're here for. We all have ideas and we all want to work on them, but how many projects do you have
unfinished? There's nothing wrong with that, we've all got lives, but what if there were a community that you could turn to for help? Someone
you knew you could trust with your brain baby?

Not ready to have brain babies of your own? Not a problem. We firmly believe that building games can be one of the most rewarding hobbies you can
have and anyone that wants to do something with games can. So whether you have an idea that's been burning your head, want to pick up an amazing
hobby, just want to learn a new skill, or literally any other reason at all, you have a home here. Find somewhere to jump in, and build something
awesome.

## What We Are Not
Money makers. If you're looking for some free labor for your super-awesome-going-to-change-the-whole-world game, look elsewhere. We're a community
of gamers that want to make the games we want to play. While we would love for some AAA studio to grab all our best ideas and put them into something
that we could all love and enjoy, that's not why any of us are here. We're here because we want to make games, plain and simple. None of the games
here are to be sold, and there will be no discussion of profit, payment, or anything else related to money.

## Organization
Development here goes through a few different stages:

1. Ideas
2. Game Design Docs (GDD's)
3. Projects

Ideas and Design Docs each have a spot in this repo, but everything that has evolved into a full-fledged project has it's own repo.

### Ideas
This is a place for you to put pretty much any idea you have. It doesn't matter how big or small, but keep it down to a single idea. If it goes
beyond that, consider starting a GDD. If you're looking for a good mechanic add depth to your game or have an idea yourself, this is the place.

### Game Design Docs
This directory is where you can find GDD's that have been started to some extent, but haven't evolved into full projects. The doc might be imcomplete,
or it may have just not gotten enough traction to grow any bigger. This is where to turn if you want to start a greenfield project.

### Projects
Let's be honest, going through the initial project organization isn't super fun for everyone. There's nothing wrong with that. If you want to just
jump into a project that's already there, find a project that sounds interesting and dive in.

## Roles
Below you can find what is in no way meant to be an exhaustive list of all the roles a game could potentially have. It's simply meant to show the
wide variety of skill sets it takes to make a game in no particular order. See something that sounds interesting? Find a project that needs one 
and dive in. Don't see anything that sounds interesting? Make something up, make a PR (you know, so it's official-like), find a project, and dive
in. We're an open community and welcome input from anyone no matter the skill set, experience, or "role".

## Rules
Every community needs some kind of bylaws. We're no exception. It's nothing huge, but make sure you're familiar with them before diving in.

* No Money. We are a community of hobbyists, not indie developers. We come here for the love of the games. That means we will never sell
anything we make here. If a game comes out that looks eerily similar to an idea or GDD that you had, be proud and play what they built too!
  * That also means don't spend any money. If you have to spend any money, odds are there's a much more restrictive license
  attached to it than our projects here, and you probably won't have distribution rights. Even if you do, just to avoid any grey areas, no money.
  This goes for engines and languages too. Don't start any project here with paid engines or using paid features of an otherwise free engine.
* Be kind. Keep in mind that we invite everyone, from all walks of life and experience levels, and they all deserve respect.
* While a GDD isn't required for any given project, we _*HIGHLY*_ recommend you have one before you get started actually building anything. You
may have a super clear idea of what you want to do, but no one can read your mind, and they shouldn't have to try. If life gets in the way and
you can no longer stay in charge of raising your brain baby, we get it. That's why we're all here in the first place. However, if there's no GDD
how will anyone else carry on your vision? It's been said that you can't design by committee. We wholeheartedly disagree. A good GDD is how that
gets done.

That's pretty much it. We want this community to be as open and available to everyone as possible, so jump in, and build something awesome.
